# Peek-A-Boo
Peek-A-Boo is a simple game to help you gain familiarity with Python programming language 
The game will display a square grid, with the columns
labeled with letters, and the rows with numbers.
Elements within the grid will be associated with pairs
of integers (a pair of 0’s, and pair or 1’s, a pair of 2’s,
etc.). Initially, we will not be able to see any of the
numbers, as they will be hidden by ‘X’ symbols. Your
job as a player is to find the hidden pairs in as few
guesses as possible. A simple menu will allow you to
interact with the game.
So let’s look at an example. The image to the right
displays the game interface when using a 4x4 grid.
You will note the following:
• The title “PEEK-A-BOO” is displayed first.
• Next, we have the grid. Column names use letters (A to D in this case), while rows are
labeled with numbers (0 to 3 in this case).
• Any individual cell in the grid is identified by a letter/number combination (e.g., A0, B2).
• When the game begins, all cells display an X (i.e., the number in the cell is ‘hidden’).
• Below the grid is a simple menu that allows you to play the game.
• The game title, grid, and menu will be displayed at all times.

Before we go any further, let’s look at the pattern of numbers that are actually hidden behind the X
symbols.
You will notice that Menu Option 3 is entitled “I give up – reveal the grid”. In short, this ends the
game and displays all hidden numbers. So if we select that option, we might see a grid display that
looks like the image below.
Note that a 4 x 4 grid has 16 cells in total. As such, it will hold 8
pairs of integers (from a pair of 0’s up to a pair of 7’s). In contrast, a
6 x 6 grid has 36 cells and therefore 18 pairs of integers (from 0’s
up to 17’s).
So when a new game is started, the grid must be initialized with a
new set of pairs, which should be randomly distributed throughout
the grid. To demonstrate this feature, we can use Menu Option 4 to
start a new game, and then use Menu Option 3 to reveal the new
distribution.
If we do that, we might see the set of numbers shown in the image
on the left. Note that we again have 8 pairs of integers but the
values are distributed in a completed different way. This, of course,
is important since the player must not be able to simply memorize
a fixed pattern.

Again, when we start a new game, all we see is a grid of
X symbols. Our job is to find the pairs. We will do this primarily by
selecting Menu Option 1, which will allow us to specify a pair of cells to test. When we do this, we
will be prompted to enter the first cell (using the letter/number format) and then the second cell
(i.e., there will be two separate input prompts, once for each cell).

Note that column letters may be given either as upper case or lower case (e.g., A or a). In any case,
once this selection is made, the contents of the two cells will be revealed (i.e., the two X’s will be
replaced by the integers associated with each of the two cells. Early in the game, it is likely that your
pair will not match, as depicted by the figure below (A0 = 7, B0 = 0). In this case, the two numbers
will remain visible for 2 seconds, at which point they will be replaced by X’s again. As a player,
your job is to try to remember the contents of these cells as
you uncover other cells in the grid, so that you can eventually
match them with the proper cell.

Of course, if the two cells match, then the numbers will
remain visible and the player continues to search for other
pairs.

It is also possible for a player to manually turn cells over if
they want to solve the game a little more quickly. To do so,
they will select Menu Option 2. In this case, they will be
prompted to enter the coordinates for a single cell. The associated X will be immediately replaced
by the number in that cell.
So that’s the basic idea. Using Menu Options 1 and 2 (but mostly Option 1), the player will work
through the grid until she/he has uncovered all of the pairs in the grid. At that point the game will
indicate that the player has won and will provide a score.

What is this score? In short, it is a number between 0 and 100 (higher is better) that represents
how quickly the player was able to find all pairs. Basically, the score reflects the number of guesses
actually taken versus the minimum number actually required. So, for example, the minimum
number of guesses for a 4 x 4 grid would be 8 (one guess for each valid pair). If the player actually
uses just 8 guesses (VERY unlikely), they will get a score of 100. The score itself is a very simple
calculation, and is computed as follows:
Score = (minimum_possible_guesses / actual_guesses) * 100
That’s it – the closer your actual guess count is to the minimum possible number of guesses, the
closer your score will be to 100.
Note: Using Option 2 counts as two guesses, so using it a lot will produce a very low score.


Important: If a player solves the puzzle
and has done so by making at least one
valid guess, then the score will always
be greater than 0.
So how does a player actually get a score
of 0? Using the example above, it would
be possible to use Menu Option 2 to
manually uncover each of the four cells,
without ever making a single guess.


In practice, the game may be played with either a 2x2 grid, a 4x4 grid, or a 6x6 grid. The size of the
grid will be passed as a command line argument when the program is run (i.e., either 2, 4, or 6).
One last thing that has to be mentioned is that the program must have basic error checking.
Otherwise, the program will fail constantly, as the player accidentally inputs a bad selection. The
error checking includes:
1. Check the command line argument to make sure that a 2, 4, or 6 has been specified. The
program can be stopped immediately if the grid size is invalid.
2. Check the menu option selections. It must be a number between 1 and 5. If a bad selection
has been made, the player must be informed and asked to enter the option again (the
program should NOT just stop).
3. The cell coordinates must be verified to ensure that the column (a letter) and the row (the
number) are valid for this grid. If not, the player should be informed and asked to enter the
cell(s) again. The image below illustrates user feedback when invalid entries are made. Note
as well that the player should not be able to enter the same cell twice when making a guess
(e.g., a0 and a0). This will make things easier for you.
